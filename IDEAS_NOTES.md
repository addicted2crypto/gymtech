## Customer Onboarding Challenges

### Domain/DNS Setup
- One-time add-on challenge for customers when signing up
- Many gym owners won't have technical knowledge for DNS configuration
- Consider: Guided wizard, video tutorials, or done-for-you setup service
- Pain point: Every "business webpage" customer without an existing domain

### Business Email Setup
- Customers without business email need help setting this up
- Options to explore:
  - Partner with email providers (Google Workspace, Zoho, etc.)
  - Offer email setup as add-on service
  - Include basic email forwarding in higher tiers
- This is a recurring pain point with each new signup

## Future Business Options

### Permanent Buyout / Transfer Option
- Some customers may want to self-host eventually
- Offer full transfer package:
  - Domain transfer
  - Database export
  - Code/assets handoff

- Pricing TBD (one-time fee vs subscription buyout)
- Could be a premium enterprise feature or separate offering
